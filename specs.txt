DRL Collision Avoidance Module Specifications

1. Overview
- The module uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enable robots to avoid collisions in dynamic environments.

2. Functional Requirements
- Input: Sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, camera, odometry).
- Output: Safe navigation commands (velocity, steering).
- Real-time decision making for obstacle avoidance.
- Training and inference modes supported.

3. System Architecture
- Core DRL agent (e.g., DQN, PPO).
- Environment interface for ROS2 topics/services.
- Data preprocessing and normalization.
- Model checkpointing and logging.

4. Integration
- ROS2 node for publishing/subscribing to relevant topics.
- Configurable parameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.).
- Launch files for training and evaluation.

5. Testing
- Unit tests for agent and environment wrappers.
- Simulation scenarios for validation.
- Performance metrics: success rate, collision count, episode length.

6. Documentation
- Usage instructions.
- API reference.
- Example launch and config files.
